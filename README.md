lingsTooltip
============

Another jQuery Tooltip plugin.

Requires jQuery 1.7 or later.

Why
---
Someone said to me, "I wish there was a jQuery Tooltip plugin which required no initializing at all". So I created this tooltip to do that, but also with the functionality that I wanted; to be able to customize the tooltip in many different ways.

How to use
